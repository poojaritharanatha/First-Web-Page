     <u><h2 id="a">About Galilei</h2></u>
  <h4>
    Galileo was the oldest of six children. His father,
    Vincenzo Galilei was a musician, his mother's name was 
    Giulia degli Ammannati. Galileo was never married but
    had a temporary relationship with Marina Gamba. they
    met on one of Galileos many trips to Venice. Marina 
    lived in Galileo's house and had 3 children, Virginia, 
    Livia, and Vincenzio. His two daughters, Sister Maria
    Celeste and Sister Arcangela, were put in convents, 
    which were religious towns. These daughters were raised
    as nuns.</p>Copernican heliocentrism is the astronomical 
    model developed by Nicolaus Copernicus and published in 1543. 
    This model positioned the Sun at the center of the Universe, motionless,
    with Earth and the other planets orbiting around it in circular paths
    modified by epicycles, and at uniform speeds. The Copernican model
    displaced the geocentric model of Ptolemy that had prevailed fo
    centuries, which had placed Earth at the center of the Universe.</p>
    Although he had circulated an outline of his own
    heliocentric theory to colleagues sometime before 1514,
    he did not decide to publish it until he was urged to do
    so later by his pupil Rheticus. Copernicus's challenge
    was to present a practical alternative to the Ptolemaic
    model by more elegantly and accurately determining the 
    length of a solar year while preserving the metaphysical
    implications of a mathematically ordered cosmos. Thus, 
    his heliocentric model retained several of the Ptolemaic
    elements, causing inaccuracies, such as the planets' 
    circular orbits, epicycles, and uniform speeds,<hr color="black">

  <h4>
    In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa.
   In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of 
   his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University 
   of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610.[40] 
   During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental 
   science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied 
   science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple 
   interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the 
   studies of mathematics and astronomy.[41][42]<hr color="black">
